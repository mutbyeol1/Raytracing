# Raytracing
This Python code can only render one sphere. But since it's only referenced from Wikipedia, it's easy to understand. So I recommend this code to anyone who is just starting out with graphics or wants to know the basics of ray tracing.

## Install and execute
```
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install numpy
```
You just run src/main.py on your IDE
